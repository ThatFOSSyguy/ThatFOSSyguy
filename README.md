# About me!
<br>
Hello, worldðŸ‘‹ I'm ThatFOSSyguy AKA Mihir Vagal. I'm a Machine Learning student who believes in the good morals of open-source, trust-less software. I got inspired by the
YouTubers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjr2bPAyPV7t35MvcgT3W8Q">TheHatedOne</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MentalOutlawStudios">Mental Outlaw</a> and <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6KfncB4OV6Vug4o_bzijg">Techlore</a> to take the E P I C turn to the open-source world.

## Why I got inspired to choose the Open-Source?
As I've mentioned earlier, I got inspired by the YouTubers TheHatedOne, Mental Outlaw and Techlore to switch to the open-source software. But why? In my opinion, Open-sorce is
better then Proprietary as it respects the user's freedom and privacy. The main reason the software was made to provide user tools, help them in their daily work while on the other hand, Proprietary software insted exploit user's data, which I think is immoral. Plus you need to trust the creator(or creators) of the software that he/them don't collect you telementary data and sell it to 3rd parties. And yeah that's the reason.

## Languages and tools I love to use
+ Python
+ Jupyter NoteBooks
+ TensorFlow 2.0
+ Pandas
+ MatPlotLib
+ TypeScript
+ VueJS
